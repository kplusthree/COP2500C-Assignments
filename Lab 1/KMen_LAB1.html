	<p> My name is Kortney Menefee, I'm 20 years old, and I'm from Punta Gorda Florida. My
	major is Digital Media for Video Game Design. I've loved video games since I could walk,
	and I grew up in a family where everyone played them. I plan on having my own company one
	day (even though everyone says that) and creating my own art in my own vision. Video games
	are more than just fun, they're art and I'm going to work my hardest while in college and
	this class to make sure I can do the best in what I'm passionte of.</p>
